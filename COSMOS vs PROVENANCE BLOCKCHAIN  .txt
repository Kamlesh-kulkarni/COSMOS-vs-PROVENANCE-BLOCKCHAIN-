- The Internet of Blockchains (IOB)
- Dual-layer Blockchain Ecosystem 
- There are currently more than 265 apps and services in the Cosmos network, including Binance Chain, Terra, Crypto , Ethereum, Bicoin.
- Cosmos apps and services connect using IBC, the Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol. This innovation enables you to freely exchange assets and data across sovereign
- The Cosmos SDK (opens new window)is an open-source framework for building multi-asset public Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains, like the Cosmos Hub, as well
- cosmos Hub is kind of Marketplace , Security provider , Router (to connect chains by establishing IBC connections with compatible chains and operating decentralized bridges with chains like Ethereum and Bitcoin.)
- IBC -> Inter-Blockchain Communication Protocol -> allows independent blockchains to directly communicate and trade assets

- Each individual blockchain maintain control of its own goverenance, but is interportable with other blockchains on the network. 
  Blockchain that do not utilize BFT(Byzantine fault-tolerence) algorithm can be connected to the cosmos network via adaptor blockchains.
  Cosmos is not designed for one perticular use case, but to be adaptable to suit many different use cases.

What is Cosmos ?
Cosmos is a project with an ambitious mission: To create a network of distributed ledgers (blockchains) that will solve long-standing problems in the cryptocurrency and blockchain communities.

The Cosmos network consists of many independent, parallel blockchains, called zones, each powered by classical Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols like Tendermint. Some zones act as hubs with respect to other zones, allowing many zones to interoperate through a shared hub. The architecture is a more general application of the Bitcoin sidechains concept, using classic BFT and Proof-of-Stake algorithms, instead of Proof-of-Work.

Provenance Blockchain -

https://www.provenance.io/


- which is designed and developed to support financial service industry needs by providing a ledger, registry, and exchange across multiple financial assets and markets. The new, public, decentralized Provenance replaces the prior permissioned Provenance blockchain launched in 2018
- The Provenance Blockchain is based on the Cosmos SDK and the Tendermint blockchain 

- Tendermint -> Tendermint Core is a blockchain application platform; it provides the equivalent of a web-server, database, and supporting libraries for blockchain applications written in any programming language. Like a web-server serving web applications, Tendermint serves blockchain applications.


cosmos 41.0

- Built using Cosmos SDK/Tendermint, the new open-source Provenance reduces the need for third-party intermediation,
  thus drastically reducing costs and freeing up capital in financial transactions

CosmWasm - 

CosmWasm is written as a module that can plug into the Cosmos SDK. This means that anyone currently building a blockchain using the Cosmos SDK can quickly and easily add CosmWasm smart contracting support to their chain


ProvWasm
Smart Contracts
Web assembly (Wasm) smart contracts for the Provenance Blockchain.

The CosmWasm VM only integrates with the banking and staking modules by default. However, it allows for adding custom encoders and queriers.
A package was added in the Provenance Blockchain that contain extensions for the following Provenance Blockchain modules:
Account
Marker
Name
Metadata - NOTE: Not yet implemented
These extensions are compiled into the blockchain at build time.
